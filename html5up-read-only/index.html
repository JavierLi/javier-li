										<h2>School</h2>
										<p>I am a full-time student in San Francisco International High School.</p>
									</header>
									<p>I believe that my school is awesome, this school is unique because we are all immigrants here. One reason I like this school is because it is small and it is much easier to talk to the teachers. All of my teachers supports everyone to succeed in life.</a> </p>
										<h3>Activities:</h3>

                                            <li>
										 Peer tutoring:
                                            </li>
										</h4>
										<p>After school, I am in charge of helping students in the common area of the school with their homework. I also I am responsible to help organize school event such as Halloween dance and Valentine's day dance. I like to be a tutor because I see a lot of people that need help with their classes, while I see myself with enough knowledge and experience to help out students willing to receive help.</p>

                                            <li>

                                            </li>

										<p>Once a week, I go to Engineering Club after school. I learn about creating Android apps and creating websites. Without Engineering Club, you wouldn't be seeing this beautiful website. I grew my interest in computer science in the club, I knew that I can put effort in making something special in my life.</p>
